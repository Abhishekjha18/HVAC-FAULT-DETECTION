# ðŸ“Š HVAC Fault Detection Dataset

## Overview
This dataset is used for developing and testing an **IoT-enabled Machine Learning (ML) solution** for **fault detection and diagnosis** in **HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) systems**. It contains time-series data capturing various HVAC parameters, enabling anomaly detection and predictive maintenance.

The dataset is sourced from the **ASHRAE Fault Detection and Diagnostics (FDD) dataset**, which is widely used for research in HVAC system efficiency, fault detection, and performance optimization.
